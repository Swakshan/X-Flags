## FAQ

#### How to enable the flags ?

The flags are present in **"feature_switch_manifest"** file, located at **"res/raw/"** inside the apk/apks file. We can modify the file and re-build the apk.

#### Is there a simplier way ?

We can use xposed/lsposed module like [TwiFucker](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/TwiFucker).

#### How to get notified when there is a build released ?

Check out my [Telegram Channel](https://telegram.me/twitter_app_flags) to keep track of new releases.

#### Is it safe to modify the flags ?

Feature flags are used by twitter employees to test new features before they are released to public. **Use it at your own risk.**
